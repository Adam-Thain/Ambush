		var t34:String = "The T-34 was a legendary tank for soviet forces during WWII with over 80,000 being produced, It introducted the concept of sloping armour to ricochet shells, it also had good overall firepower and mobility, its design was easy for mass production and some were known to go straight into battle from the factory gates.";
		var m6:String = "The M6 was a prototype American heavy tank that was armed with a 90mm which would have proved effectively against german armour during WWII, however despite its advantages over medium tanks, these were offset by many shortcomings, only 40 were ever built and they never saw action.";
		var kv2:String = "The KV2 was a heavy tank of the soviet forces, despite being slow, it had a powerful cannon that was made for busting bunkers, only 300 were made as it was slow and couldn't effectively be used in the fast paced nature of tank warfare during WWII.";
		
		//enemy tanks
		var vk3006:String = "A prototype tank that help to pave the way for the development of the tiger, the vk3006 only had 9 chassis produced and one full vehicle completed by 1942, the only prototype was later converted into an armoured recovery vehicle and the development was cancelled in favour of fully developing the tiger tank."
		var pz4A:String = "The first produced verision of the panzer 4 that contributed to the 8,000 total produced, it was armed with a small cannon but was reliable and mobile and helped to form the core of the nazis armoured element of its blitzkrieg forces, its armour however could only withstand smalls arms fire and shrapnel."
		var pz4H:String = "The most produced version of the Panzer 4 that contributed to the 8,000 total produced, it was armed with a 75mm cannon and was reliable, its simple design and ease of manufacturing meant it could be easily adapt to counter the new threats that it faced during the course of the war."
		var pz6AustBTiger2:String = "The most powerful and most feared German tank of WWII to see combat, it could destroy enemy tanks from 1km away with its powerful and accurate 88mm cannon and its very thick front armour could withstand the shots from most allied guns, however, it was slow, overweight and only 400 were ever made."
		var e100:String = "A German super heavy tank ahead of its time that weighed 140 tons, had armour in places up to 200mm thick and was armed with a 150mm cannon, only the chassis was complete by the end of WWII where it was shipped to the uk for testing before scrapage."
